## About

These are sample NIfTI images designed for evaluating viewing tools like [NiiVue](https://github.com/niivue/niivue). These are intentionally low-resolution images to reduce file size and ensure compatibility with old computers and mobile devices. Larger but higher quality images are available by downloading the [Extra Sample Images](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricrogl). Further examples are available in the [VolumeRenderingData](https://github.com/neurolabusc/VolumeRenderingData) repository.
